# BdwLib
BdwLib is a general purpose library written in C, it provides some utility 
functions for strings, files and the most commonly used data structures like 
simple and doubly-linked Lists, Stacks and Queues.

It's partially based on the functions offered by [GLib](https://developer.gnome.org/glib).
